# Python Developer Internship - Task Submissions 🚀

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Python Developer Internship, starting January 15, 2026.

---

## 📅 Task 1: Environment Setup & First Script
**File:** `hello_world.py`  
**Date:** 15/01/26

### Description
Setup of the Python development environment and creation of an interactive script to handle basic user identification.

### Key Objectives:
- **Variable Storage:** Storing user information in variables instead of hardcoding strings.
- **Dynamic Input:** Modified the script to accept `input()` from the terminal for Name and Role.
- **Execution Flow:** Learned to trigger scripts directly from the macOS terminal.
- **Readability:** Implemented line-by-line commenting to establish best practices.

## 🔢 Task 2: Data Types & Operations Demo
**File:** `datatypes_demo.py`
**Date:** 16/01/26

### Description
A deep dive into how Python manages memory and data through dynamic typing and mathematical operations.

### 🚀 Features
- **Variable Management:** Declaration and type checking for `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
- **Dynamic Typing:** Demonstration of how Python reassigns variable types at runtime.
- **Data Conversion:** Practical examples of casting string inputs into numeric types using `int()` and `float()`.
- **Arithmetic Logic:** Execution of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Concatenation:** Best practices for joining strings with numeric data using `str()` and f-strings.

## 📊 Task 3: Logical Operations & Grade Calculator
**File:** `grade_calculator.py` | **Date:** 19/01/26

### Description
Developed a multi-subject grade calculator that applies real-world business rules using conditional logic.

### 🚀 Features
- **Multi-Subject Input:** Collects marks for Math, Science, Social, and English.
- **Logical Operators:** Used `and` and `or` to define complex grading boundaries (e.g., `sum > 35 or sum == 40`).
- **Nested Conditions:** Implemented a "Just Pass" rule for specific total marks and a failure identification system.
- **Data Validation:** Included logic to ensure inputs are within valid numeric ranges (0-100).
- **Refactored Code:** Cleaned up logic for high readability and efficient execution.

## 🔁 Task 4: Loops & Control Flow
**File:** `loop_tasks.py`  | **Date:** 20/01/26

### Description
Explored the automation power of loops, transitioning from basic iteration to real-world simulation systems.

### 🚀 Features
- **Iterative Sequences:** Used `for` loops and `range(start, stop, step)` to handle fixed datasets.
- **Dynamic Conditions:** Implemented `while` loops for countdown timers and interactive menu systems.
- **Loop Control:** Applied `break` to exit loops upon meeting conditions and `continue` to filter/skip data.
- **Real-World Application:** Developed an **ATM Withdrawal System** that utilizes a `while True` loop for continuous input validation and a `for` loop to calculate currency denominations (500, 200, 100 notes).

## 🛠️ Task 5: Modular Programming with Functions
**File:** `calculator.py` | **Date:** 22/01/26

### Description
Transitioned from linear scripting to procedural programming by building a modular calculator.

### 🚀 Features
- **Functional Isolation:** Created independent functions for `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
- **Default Arguments:** Implemented default parameters to handle cases where a second input is missing.
- **Error Resilience:** Added specific logic to prevent "Division by Zero" crashes.
- **Documentation:** Used Python Docstrings to explain the purpose and parameters of every function.
- **Return Logic:** Used `return` values to separate calculation logic from user interface (display) logic.

## Task 6: Advanced Collection Management
**Status:** Completed ✅

- Successfully implemented List deduplication via Set casting.
- Conducted Set Theory analysis (Union, Intersection, Difference).
- Verified data integrity protocols using Immutable Tuples.

##Task 7: Data Serialization with JSON
**File: student_records.py | **Date: 26/01/26

🚀 Key Implementations
Nested Dictionaries: Structured complex student data using unique keys.
JSON Serialization: Used json.dump() and json.load() for persistent storage.
File Handling: Implemented robust file I/O to save and retrieve records from student_records.json.
Data Formatting: Applied advanced f-string alignment for professional tabular reporting.
🛠️ Technical Skills
CRUD Logic: Performed Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on dictionary objects.
Serialization Control: Mastered the use of indent, sort_keys, and ensure_ascii for standardized output.
Data Integrity: Verified round-trip data consistency between Python objects and external files.
