## 📅 Task 1: Environment Setup & First Script
**File:** `hello_world.py`  
**Date:** 15/01/26

### Description
Setup of the Python development environment and creation of an interactive script to handle basic user identification.

### Key Objectives:
- **Variable Storage:** Storing user information in variables instead of hardcoding strings.
- **Dynamic Input:** Modified the script to accept `input()` from the terminal for Name and Role.
- **Execution Flow:** Learned to trigger scripts directly from the macOS terminal.
- **Readability:** Implemented line-by-line commenting to establish best practices.

## 🔢 Task 2: Data Types & Operations Demo
**File:** `datatypes_demo.py`
**Date:** 16/01/26

### Description
A deep dive into how Python manages memory and data through dynamic typing and mathematical operations.

### 🚀 Features
- **Variable Management:** Declaration and type checking for `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
- **Dynamic Typing:** Demonstration of how Python reassigns variable types at runtime.
- **Data Conversion:** Practical examples of casting string inputs into numeric types using `int()` and `float()`.
- **Arithmetic Logic:** Execution of Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Concatenation:** Best practices for joining strings with numeric data using `str()` and f-strings.
