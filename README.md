PYTHON DEVELOPER INTERNSHIP (15/01/26)TASK 1: Python Environment Setup & First Script-.Create a Python file named hello_world.py.Write a program to print your name, internship role, and today's date.Use variables to store values instead of hardcoding them.Run the program from terminal to understand execution flow.Modify the script to accept user input for name and role.Add comments explaining each line to build readability habits.
Task2:# Python Data Types & Operations Demo

A practical Python script demonstrating core programming concepts including dynamic typing, variable declaration, arithmetic operations, and type casting.

## 🚀 Features

- **Variable Management:** Declaration and type checking for `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
- **Dynamic Typing:** Demonstration of how Python reassigns variable types at runtime.
- **Data Conversion:** Practical examples of casting string inputs into numeric types.
- **Arithmetic Logic:** Basic mathematical operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
- **Concatenation:** Best practices for joining strings with numeric data.

## 🛠️ How it Works

The script takes user input for name, roll number, and price, then performs the following logic:
1. Validates data types using the `type()` function.
2. Performs math on user-provided integers.
3. Demonstrates the flexibility of Python's memory management by changing variable types mid-script.
